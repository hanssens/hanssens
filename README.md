Hi, I'm Juliën Hanssens. I consider myself, in no particular order, to be a digital architect, devoted developer, hardcore geek, movie buff, co-founder of two kids and a multithreaded [Dutchman](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nederland/).

In my spare time I enjoy life with my family and two kids. Balancing out family and work is challenging, to say the least. But when these “planets align”, or better put when time permits, I try to keep up by [researching sparkly dev stuff](https://stackshare.io/hanssens), have some [fun with open source](https://github.com/hanssens) and on occasion [try to help other developers](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1039247/juli%c3%abn).

Cheers,
    Juliën Hanssens
